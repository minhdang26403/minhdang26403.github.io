I am a Member of Technical Staff at Nutanix, specializing in building robust and high-performance distributed systems. My core work involves designing and building infrastructure for backup and replication diverse storage systems, from internal distributed file systems to cloud targets like AWS.

I am driven to apply this systems expertise to the next generation of AI workloads. My focus is expanding into MLSys, specifically on building large-scale LLM serving infrastructure and optimizing efficient LLM inference—problems that are a natural extension of my distributed systems background.

I'm always eager to discuss challenges in C++, distributed systems, or building scalable infrastructure for production AI.
